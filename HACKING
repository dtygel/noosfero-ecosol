= Noosfero instructions for developers

== A work about your the development platform

These instructions are tested and known to work on Debian stable, which is the
system that the Noosfero core developers use to work on Noosfero.

If you want to use another OS, read "Instructions for other systems" below.

== Instructions for Debian stable

Download the source code:

  $ git clone git://gitorious.org/noosfero/noosfero.git
  $ cd noosfero

Run the quick start script:

  $ ./script/quick-start

Now you can execute the development server with:

  $ ./script/development

You will be able to access Noosfero at http://localhost:3000/

If you want to use a different port than 3000, pass `-p <PORT>` to
./script/development

== Instructions for other systems

On other OS, you have 2 options:

1) using a chroot or a VM with Debian stable (easier)

Use a chroot (http://wiki.debian.org/Schroot) or a Virtual Machine (e.g. with
VirtualBox) with a Debian stable system and follow the instructions above for
Debian stable.

2) Installing dependencies on other OS (harder)

If you want to setup a development environment in another OS, you can create a
file under script/install-dependencies/, called <OS>-<CODENAME>.sh, which
installed the dependencies for your system. With this script in place,
./script/quick-start will call it at the point of installing the required
packages for Noosfero development.

You can check script/install-dependencies/debian-squeeze.sh to have an idea of
what kind of stuff that script has to do. 

If you write such script for your own OS, *please* share it with us at the
development mailing list so that we can include it in the official repository.
This way other people using the same OS will have to put less effort to develop
Noosfero.
